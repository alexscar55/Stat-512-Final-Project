Analyzed the primary factors affecting the COVID-19 death rate across counties in Indiana. We utilized publicly available datasets to compare indicators such as infection rate, vaccine rate, demographic factors, and the presence of high-risk individuals. Our goal was to identify groups more prone to severe outcomes and provide insights for public health strategies to reduce mortality. 
Through our analysis, we found that vaccine rate, percentage of the population at high risk, and average age of COVID-19 deaths were the most significant predictors. Transforming our data improved the normality of our variables, allowing for accurate hypothesis testing and reliable conclusions. This project offers valuable information for targeting preventive measures and resources effectively.
